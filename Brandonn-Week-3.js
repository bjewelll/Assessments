1. Write a simple React component that simply prints "I am a component" to the screen. Be sure to include all necessary imports, exports, etc...

import React, {Component} from 'react'

class Object extends Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <div><h1>I am a component</h1></div>
    )
  }
}

export default Object



2. Practice With Loops: In React, we often use the map function to iterate over an array held in state. To get more practice with this, write a vanilla javascript for loop that outputs the same thing as the map function below.


var stuffArray = [42, "Arthur Dent", 1978, "Zaphod", "Vogon", "Marvin, the Paranoid Android"]

stuffArray.map(function(el, i){
  console.log(el + " is at index: " + i)
})

// your for loop here, you can reference the same stuffArray variable
for ( let i = 0; i < stuffArray.length; i++ ){
  console.log(stuffArray[i] + " is a index: " + i)
}

3. Basic sorting: Find the cheapest price -- you are given a list of prices and need to find the signle lowest price from the array. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers, and returns the lowest price

var numbers = [3,5,2,10,6,3]

var steal = function(){
  var lowest = numbers[0]
    for ( let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++ ){
      if( numbers[i] < lowest ){
        lowest = numbers[i]
      }
    }
    return lowest
  }
  // your logic here
