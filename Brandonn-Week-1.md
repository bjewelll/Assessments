### Week 1 Assessment

These are potential interview questions. Try your best to answer each question on your own before looking up the answer online.

#### 1. One great resource for learning Javascript is Eloquent Javascript - read this chapter on functions (http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html) and list a few thoughts, questions, or things you learned here:

  //this topic is really confusing hopefully it will make more sense after more practice.

#### 2. What is a linter for? Do you think they are usefull? Explain why/why not.

// Linter is a process that will check your written code for mistakes and it will also make suggestion about how to improve your syntax. I really like this because it will help you keep a cleaner code and more readable.

#### 3. Explain local vs global scope in programming. Feel free to create a code example to support your answer.

  //Your Answer
  //global scope is when a item can be accessed by any other item anywhere in your code. Local scope is when the item is inside a function and can only be accessed inside the function. It cannot be accessed anywhere outside the function.

  //Googled Answer
JavaScript has two scopes – global and local. Any variable declared outside of a function belongs to the global scope, and is therefore accessible from anywhere in your code. Each function has its own scope, and any variable declared within that function is only accessible from that function and any nested functions. Because local scope in JavaScript is created by functions, it’s also called function scope. When we put a function inside another function, then we create nested scope.

#### 4. Another great resource for more practice writing code is Free Code Camp. Their Javascript section starts here (https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/comment-your-javascript-code) - do at least 5 exercises.

Was this extra practice helpful? Take note of any concepts you learned or felt you understood better because of this resource.

  //yes it really helped also will do some work on code wars    

#### 5. Complete the steps for pushing changes to Github, assuming that the directory you are working in is already a git repo:

- git add .
- git commit-m "New repo changes"
- git push-u origin master

#### 6. List some differences between return and console.log in Javascript. When would you use one vs the other?
//console log just prints out the result of your code. This can help you in many ways. If you want to check your progress to see if your code works you can console.log it.Return will stop aa function and return its value.
#### 7. Think back to the intro to Javascript presentation. We talked about Javascript being a "Dynamically Typed" language. What did this mean about the way we write Javascript?

//this means JavaScript has more flexibility when it comes to enforcing correct typing and you dont need data type.


// Googled Answer
JavaScript is weakly typed. It is most certainly not "untyped" but its weakly typed nature allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of implicit conversions. Keep in mind that JavaScript is also dynamically typed. This method of typing allows what is know as "duck typing".
